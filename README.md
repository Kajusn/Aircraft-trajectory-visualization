## Aircraft trajectory visualization: Vilnius case

This is the repository for my thesis project titled "Aircraft trajectory visualization: Vilnius case".
Vilnius University, Software Engineering Bachelor's, fourth year, second semester.

### Objective

The goal of this branch is to adjust the current Aircraft trajectory visualization prototype in an effort to:
* Make it more modular (no hard-coded paths, data, magic variables)
* Make it easier to apply it to a different environment (in this case Vilnius airport)
* Have cleaner and more readable code
